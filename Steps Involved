# Steps Involved
Objective
Design an interactive dashboard in Power BI for business stakeholders using a Sales/Financial dataset (here: Product_Sales.csv). The dashboard should display KPIs, allow interactivity via slicers, and provide insights on sales agent performance and call analysis.

Step 1: Import Data

1.1 Open Power BI Desktop.

1.2 Get Data → Text/CSV → select Product_Sales.csv.

1.3 Ensure correct column datatypes:

    1.3.1 CallID, CustomerID → Whole Number

    1.3.2 Agent_Name → Text

    1.3.3 Duration → Whole Number

    1.3.4 PickedUp, ProductSold → Whole Number (0/1)

Step 2: Create Measures (DAX)

Defined new KPIs using Modeling → New Measure:

2.1 Total Calls = COUNTROWS(Product_Sales)
2.2 Total Pickups = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Product_Sales), Product_Sales[PickedUp] = 1)
2.3 Pickup Rate % = DIVIDE([Total Pickups], [Total Calls], 0)
2.4 Total Products Sold = SUM(Product_Sales[ProductSold])
2.5 Conversion Rate % = DIVIDE([Total Products Sold], [Total Pickups], 0)
2.6 Avg Call Duration = AVERAGE(Product_Sales[Duration])

Step 3: Dashboard Pages
3.1 Page 1 → Executive Summary

3.1.1 Card Visuals:
Total Calls, Total Pickups, Pickup Rate %, Total Products Sold, Conversion Rate %, Avg Call Duration.

3.1.2 Slicers:
Agent_Name, PickedUp (0/1 → “Picked / Not Picked”), ProductSold (0/1 → “Sold / Not Sold”).

Layout: Cards aligned at top, slicers on side for easy filtering.

3.2 Page 2 → Agent Performance
3.2.1 Clustered Bar Chart: Agent_Name vs. Total Products Sold.

3.2.2 Stacked Column Chart: Agent_Name vs. Total Calls & Total Pickups.

3.2.3 Table Visual: Agent_Name with Total Calls, Pickups, Products Sold, Conversion Rate %.

3.3 Page 3 → Call Duration Analysis
3.3.1 Histogram: Distribution of call durations (grouped into bins, e.g., 60 sec).

3.3.2 Box & Whisker Plot (custom visual): Agent_Name vs. Call Duration (to analyze spread).

3.3.3 Slicer: ProductSold (filter durations based on success).

Step 4: Formatting
4.1 Applied consistent theme (View → Themes).

4.2 Converted slicers to dropdowns for clean look.

4.3 Adjusted card formatting (bold, large font).

4.4 Added dashboard title with Text Box.

Step 5: Navigation
5.1 Created Bookmarks (View → Bookmarks Pane).

5.2 Inserted Buttons for navigation (Insert → Buttons → Blank → Action → Bookmark).

5.3 Created a navigation menu for smooth switching between pages.

Step 6: Exporting to PowerPoint

Two methods used (I used Static One):
6.1 Interactive Method → Power BI Add-in for PowerPoint (Insert → Add-ins → Get Add-ins → Power BI → Embed live report).

6.2 Static Method → Export from Power BI Service (File → Export → PowerPoint → static or embed live data).

# Deliverables

Interactive Power BI Dashboard with 3 pages:
Executive Summary
Agent Performance
Call Duration Analysis
PPT Summary with embedded dashboard and static snapshots.
